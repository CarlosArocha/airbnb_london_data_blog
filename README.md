# airbnb_london_data_blog

Working with the public **airbnb** data for London as my first project in _Udacity Nanodegree Data Science_ course

## Type of file:

**Python** in a Jupiter-Notebook

## Filename:

udacity-datascience-1stproject-blog-carlosarocha.ipynb

## Libraries needed in your environment:

	* numPy
	* pandas
	* matplotlib
	* datetime
	* os
	* re
	* mpl_toolkits
	* sklearn

## Data:

The airbnb public data files used in this repository couldn't be uploaded for their size.
You need to use this link to access the data:[inside_airbnb_public_data](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)
Or search for it directly in this webpage: [www.insideairbnb.com](http://insideairbnb.com)

Look for the London data and download the next files:

	* listings.csv.gz for **November 2020**
	* listings.csv.gz for **October 2019**
	* listings.csv.gz for **October 2018**
	* listings.csv.gz for **April 2017**
	* calendar.csv.gz for **November 2020**
	* reviews.csv.gz for **November 2020**

## Change Initial Path:

After download the data listed before, you have to change the **paths** placed at the beginning of the code, used to download the data into the program.
The next path need to be updated with the new location of the data:

	* path_l20
	* path_l19
	* path_l18
	* path_l17
	* path_c20
	* path_r20

## Run:

After these steps the code must run smoothly.

Enjoy!
